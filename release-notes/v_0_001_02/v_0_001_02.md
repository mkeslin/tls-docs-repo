### New Features

**Autocomplete Controls**  
The select list controls have been replaced with autocomplete controls, which allow search filtering.

**Incident Relationship Indicators**  
The background colors have been fixed so that they accurately indicate the correct relationship.

### Bug Fixes

**Master Person Search**  
Previously, a new search was being executed with every character change. This behavior has been changed to work like the other master searches.

**Some incidents not loading**  
Previously, some incidents wouldn't load. We fixed the underlying issue to resolve this problem.
