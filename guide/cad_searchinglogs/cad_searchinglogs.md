***This includes calls generated from full CAD and Self Dispatch.***

Call results are displayed below based on the criteria selected above.

### Viewing and Printing Call Sheets

The call sheets can be open by selecting the document icon on the result list.

The calls from service can be printed by selecting the elipsies (...) at the end of the record and choosing what kind of report you would like to print for each individual call sheet.

Multiple call sheets can be batch printed based on your search criteria by selecting the printer icon in the search options and selecting the batch option.  This is a good tool for generating reports of all of the calls that happened during a shift or week.  This is also a good tool for providing call logs to agencies that are not part of the Thin Line Software family.
