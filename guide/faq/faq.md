## Can I add a user if I do not know what the new user's email will be?

**YES**.  The long answer is, you can use a personal email or what you think their email might be and that will work until you know what their "real" email will be.  If the user gets their real email and it is different than what you entered you can always change it later (See the administrating users section for more inforamtion).

## Can I retrieve a report that was run by me or someone else in the past?

**YES**.  All reports that are created are stored for a period of three years.  To access these reports you need to go to the Home icon in the upper left side of the toolbar and then click "Report History".  This screen will allow you to select the reports that you have run and filter by the date and time.  If your user has the claim "Admin.Reports.AccessAllUsers" or is in the role of "RMS_SUPERVISOR" you will be able to see all of the user's reports.

## Why am I not seeing a module or data that everyone else sees?

* The modules you see our customized to your security claims and agency settings.  If you do not see a module you think you should you should contact your system administrator to **check your permissions.**

* Each agency will maintain its own settings and data seperate from the other modules.  **Confirm that you are logged into the correct agency.**  You can do this by looking at the top of the application on the center right to see the agency logo and name.  If you are in the wrong agency you will want to click on your avatar in the upper right corner and select the correct agency from the agency drop down.

## Some of the dropdowns in the system do not have the values I want?

Most of the codes in the system that are not NIBRS specific are customizable to your agency's needs.  Please contact your administrator to add/remove/edit codes in the system.
