# Trouble Shooting

### It is telling me my user name and password is incorrect.

* Make sure your CAPS Lock is not on.  An easy way to do this is to click the "Show Password" check box.  This will show you what you have typed so you con confirm that this is your actual password.
* Check with your administrator to make sure your account is not locked or disabled.
* Make sure you are using the correct username.  If you do not remember what your user name is, your administrator will be able to help you.
* If all else fails, your administrator will be able to reset your password and give you a temporary password that should allow you to login.

### I log in but the application is giving me an error or is just spinning.

* Check your computer's clock in the lower right hand corner of your screen.  If the clock is wrong you will not be able to login to the application.  This is an added security feature.  **Your clock must be set correctly in order to login to the system.**
* Confirm that the link you used to get to the application is not a link to the login page.  Your links and bookmarks can be to any page in the application but not to the login page.  It should look like https://agencyName.thinlinesoftware.com/dashboard.
