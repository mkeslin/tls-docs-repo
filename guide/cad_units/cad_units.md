## Organizing Units

You can choose how to organize your units to meet your needs and preferences.

* Agency - Units are shown broken down by the agency they belong to.  **This is the default.**
* Status - Units are shown broken down the the unit state.
* None - The units are not broken down at all.  You can still see the agency based on the color schemes.  **This is the most compact display.**

The groups can be all collapsed or all opened with the use of the following buttons on the unit header.

## Hiding and Showing Inactive Units

Inactive units can be hidden from view with the slider on the Units header as show below.

You can hide inactive units until you need to bring an inactive unit online.  This will keep the list of units you will need to search through to a minimum.

## Brining Units In and Out of Service

Offline units will show an "up arrow" on the right side of the unit with a label of "INACTIVE" under the unit.  To bring a unit on line you will just click the up arrow and the unit will be online and ready to assign to calls.

A unit can be brought offline when it is in the "AVAILABLE" state.  To take an available unit offline you will start by clicking the elipses (...) next to the unit and clicking the "Inactive" button with the down arrow.

***If the unit is assigned to calls it must be taken off the call before it can be brought offline.***
