# Notepads Overview

The Notepad module is a tool for keeping track of things that only need to be documented for internal purposes.  This module is a versatile module that can be used to keep track of many things.  There are three main types of Notepad entry records that you can use.

## Field Contact

This module can be used to note contact with people and property that might be important to note, but the circumstances do not warrant an Incident or Citation.

## Lost and Found

From time-to-time people bring things into the Police that have been found or things that need safe keeping.  This Notepad type allows the agency to store information about property that they have in custody because of a “lost and found” situation.

***This property is not stored in Evidence and no Chain of Custody will be kept for the property.***

## Note

The Note type can be used for any kind of note that needs to be kept that is not part of an Incident or Citation.  Notes could be in the form of an officer note about something they need to do, an agency "To Do" list, or a note about a property that needs to be associated to a person or address.  Your options with the "Note" type are endless.
