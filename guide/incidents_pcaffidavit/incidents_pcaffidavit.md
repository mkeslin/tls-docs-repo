# Incidents Probable Cause Affidavit

Probable Cause Affidavits can be entered and printed directly from a person's arrest record on an incident.

## Navigating to the PC Affidavit

You can access the PC Affidavit in an Incident record by opening the Incident record and navigating to the 'Persons & Organizations' tab.  If a person's role is already specified as an 'Arrestee' then you can access the existing arrest information by clicking the View icon on the Arrest record for the person you are working with.  This will open the Arrest Record details.

After clicking the Arrest record you will see the following screen.
