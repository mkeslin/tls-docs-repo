### Searching and Adding

<img src="navapp_personsearch.png" />

Enter the search terms you are looking for.  In the case of a master person record you may type in any of the properties of the person and as you fill in the information a search will be performed on any existing records and they will appear in the results section.
If you do not see the result, you would like you can click the “Add” button and add a new record will be created.
<img src="navapp_personsadded.png" />

You can click on the green record added message or in the search results to view and edit the new record.

### Viewing and Editing

When you see the record you are searching for you can double click the record or click on the View document icon on the left side of the record to open the View Details and Edit left slide out.

From the master detail slide out you can navigate from the tab menu on the top to see all of the details.  You can edit by selecting the field you would like to change and the record will be in edit mode.  When you are done you can click the “Save Changes” button or the “Undo Changes” button to revert the record back to the way it was before you made any changes.

## Module Menu

The module menu will change depending on the module you are working with.  The options you have will be similar to those on the left module menu bar with an addition of a quick record jump at the top of the module menu.  The user can type a record number into the quick record jump and click the lightning bolt to navigate directly to the record details.

<img src="navapp_modulemenu.png" />

These buttons can be used to navigate inside the module without having to go back to the left module menu.

## Pinned and Recent Menu

When the user is in a module you will see a Pinned and Recent Menu below the Module Menu.  Both pinned ad recent items are displayed with the module, record number, and agency.
<img src="navapp_pinnedrecent.png" />

### Pinned Records

Pinned records are records that the user would like to keep flagged for later access.  The user can pin a record that has been opened recently by clicking on the pin icon in the Recent list or by clicking on the pin icon on the record in the upper left-hand side of the record details.
<img src="navapp_pinfromrecord.png" />

If the pin icon is filled and dark in color then the record is pinned and if the pin is outlined then the record has not been pinned.
To unpin a record, click the pin icon again until the icon goes from dark to outlined.

### Recent Records

The system will automatically keep track of the last 5 records that you have opened and display them in the Recent List.

## Active Module Details

The remaining center portion of the screen is reserved for the active module’s contents.  This will be in the form of a search screen or record details, and this content will vary, depending on what module you are working on.
