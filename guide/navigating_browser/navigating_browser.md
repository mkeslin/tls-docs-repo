## Working with Multiple Tabs

Because Thin Line Software is hosted inside of your web browser there are many features that the web browser provides that can increase your efficiency and overall experience while using the software.  One of the most powerfull features is the ability to have multiple tabs open at once.  For example, one tab can contain CAD, another tab can contain RMS, and yet another tab can contain an Incident report you are actively working on.  With this tab setup described above, you will be able to switch between the tabs freely as you need to.

Please see the following tutorial video for more help and examples of working with multiple browser tabs.
